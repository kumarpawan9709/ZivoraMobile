# iOS Project Setup - Complete Workspace Download

Your Zivora app has a complete iOS project setup with:
- ✅ `App.xcworkspace` - Main Xcode workspace file
- ✅ `App.xcodeproj` - Xcode project file
- ✅ Capacitor configuration
- ✅ iOS app icons and settings

## iOS Files Structure

```
ios/

│   ├── App.xcworkspace/          # Main workspace (open this in Xcode)
│   ├── App.xcodeproj/            # Xcode project
│   ├── Podfile                   # CocoaPods dependencies
│   └── App/                      # iOS app source code
└── capacitor-cordova-ios-plugins/ # Capacitor plugins
```

## How to Get Complete iOS Project

### Method 1: Download Individual iOS Files

If the ZIP download didn't include iOS files properly:

1. **In Replit file explorer:**
   - Navigate to `ios/` folder
   - Right-click on `App` folder
   - Select "Download" to get the complete iOS project

2. **Alternative - Download key files:**
   - Download `ios/App/App.xcworkspace` (most important)
   - Download `ios/App/App.xcodeproj`
   - Download `ios/App/Podfile`
   - Download entire `ios/App/App/` folder

### Method 2: Regenerate iOS Project

If you're missing iOS files, run these commands locally:

```bash
# After downloading your main project
npm install
npx cap add ios
npx cap sync ios
```

This will regenerate the complete iOS project with all workspace files.

### Method 3: Manual Setup

1. **Download your React project** (which you already did)
2. **Install Capacitor CLI:** `npm install -g @capacitor/cli`
3. **Add iOS platform:** `npx cap add ios`
4. **Sync project:** `npx cap sync ios`
5. **Open in Xcode:** `npx cap open ios`

## Opening in Xcode

**Important:** Always open the `.xcworkspace` file, not the `.xcodeproj` file:

```bash
open ios/App/App.xcworkspace
```

## What You Need for App Store

The iOS project includes:
- ✅ Proper bundle ID: `com.zivora.migraintracker`
- ✅ App icons configured
- ✅ Capacitor plugins setup
- ✅ iOS 14.0+ deployment target
- ✅ All necessary permissions

## Troubleshooting Missing iOS Files

If your download is missing iOS files:

1. **Check ZIP contents** - Look for `ios/` folder
2. **Re-download** - Try downloading the project again
3. **Manual recreation** - Use Method 2 above to regenerate
4. **Contact support** - If Replit export isn't working properly

## Next Steps

1. **Verify iOS files** in your downloaded project
2. **Run `npx cap sync ios`** if any files are missing
3. **Open workspace** in Xcode: `ios/App/App.xcworkspace`
4. **Build and archive** for App Store submission

Your iOS project is fully configured and ready for App Store submission once you have all the files properly downloaded.
