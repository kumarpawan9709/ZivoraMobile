# Apple Watch Data Integration Status

## Current Status: **NOT WORKING**

Apple Watch data integration is currently **not functional** in the Zivora app. Here's the detailed breakdown:

### What's Currently Available:
✅ **UI Elements**: Settings screen shows "Apple Health" toggle with "Heart rate, sleep, activity" description
✅ **Database Schema**: Added `health_data` table to store health metrics
✅ **Placeholder Integration**: Non-functional UI toggles for Apple Health connection

### What's Missing:
❌ **HealthKit Plugin**: No actual iOS HealthKit integration
❌ **Health Permissions**: No iOS health data permissions requested
❌ **Data Sync**: No real-time sync from Apple Watch/Health app
❌ **API Endpoints**: No backend routes to process health data

### Why It's Not Working:
1. **Platform Limitation**: This is a web-based React app, not a native iOS app
2. **No HealthKit Access**: Web apps cannot directly access iOS HealthKit data
3. **Missing Native Plugin**: Would need Capacitor HealthKit plugin for iOS integration
4. **iOS App Store Required**: Full Apple Watch integration requires native iOS app deployment

### To Make Apple Watch Data Work:
1. **Deploy iOS App**: The Capacitor iOS app needs to be deployed to App Store
2. **Add HealthKit Plugin**: Install proper iOS HealthKit integration
3. **Request Permissions**: Add health data permissions to iOS app
4. **Backend APIs**: Create endpoints to receive and process health data
5. **Real-time Sync**: Implement continuous health data synchronization

### Current Workaround:
Users can manually enter health metrics in the Daily Log screen:
- Heart rate
- Sleep hours
- Stress levels
- Activity minutes

### Alternative Solutions:
- **Fitbit Integration**: Can work with web apps via OAuth (requires API keys)
- **Manual Entry**: Users input health data manually
- **Third-party APIs**: Integration with health platforms that support web access

### Timeline:
Apple Watch integration would require:
- 2-3 days for native iOS HealthKit implementation
- App Store approval process (1-7 days)
- iOS app distribution to users

**Bottom Line**: Apple Watch data is NOT currently working and requires significant native iOS development to function properly.
