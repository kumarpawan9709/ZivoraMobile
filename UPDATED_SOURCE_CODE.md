# ðŸ”„ Updated Zivora Mobile Source Code

## Issue Resolved: Latest Changes Now Included

The previous download didn't include your latest changes because the archive was created before your recent modifications. I've now created a fresh package with all your current changes.

## âœ… Fresh Download Available

**New File:** `zivora-mobile-latest-source.tar.gz`

### **What's Fixed:**
- âœ… All your latest changes are now included
- âœ… Custom app icon implementation
- âœ… Email/password authentication (no Google/Apple login)
- âœ… App Store compliance modifications
- âœ… Current UI updates and improvements
- âœ… Latest database schema and API changes

### **Current Configuration Verified:**
- **App Name:** Zivora
- **Bundle ID:** com.zivora.migrainertracker
- **Authentication:** Email/password only (App Store compliant)
- **Custom App Icon:** Implemented and configured
- **Status:** All latest changes included

### **Why This Happened:**
The previous archive was created from an earlier state of the project. Archives are snapshots of the code at a specific time, so if changes are made after creating the archive, they won't be included in the download.

### **Fresh Package Includes:**
1. **Latest React Frontend** - All your recent UI changes
2. **Updated Backend APIs** - Current server implementation
3. **iOS Capacitor Project** - With latest configurations
4. **Custom App Icon Assets** - Properly integrated
5. **Current Authentication System** - Email/password only
6. **Latest Database Schema** - All recent changes applied

## Download Instructions

1. **Download:** `zivora-mobile-latest-source.tar.gz`
2. **Extract:** All files to your desired location
3. **Setup:** Run `npm install` (automatic setup)
4. **Develop:** Run `npm run dev` to start

## Verification

The new archive contains all files with timestamps matching your latest modifications. You should now see:
- Custom app icon in the iOS project
- Email/password authentication only
- All recent UI and backend changes
- Current database schema and API implementations

Your complete Zivora mobile app with all latest changes is now ready for download.
