Build a Flutter app that replicates the ZIVORA splash screen and onboarding screen with identical look and functionality.

ðŸ“± SCREEN 1: Splash Screen (Initial)
Design Details:

Background: Pure black (Colors.black)

Centered icon: Brain/head icon (use Flutter's Icons.psychology as a placeholder)

Text:

ZIVORA (bold, all caps, color: Colors.purpleAccent, font size: 32)

"Welcome to Zivora mobile app" below in smaller font and Colors.white54

Transition: Auto-navigate to next screen after 2 seconds using Future.delayed.

ðŸ“± SCREEN 2: Onboarding Screen 1
Design Details:

Background: Black

Header text:

"Migraine is more than a" (white)

"headache." (purple/violet)
Use RichText or different TextSpan styles.

ðŸ§  Image:

Use the brain illustration from the screenshot.

You can extract the brain image directly from the uploaded screenshot or use any asset file named assets/brain.png.

Description Box:

Add a rounded dark box with the text:
"Migraine is a brain state that affects your senses, mood, and body â€” causing symptoms like dizziness, fatigue, nausea, and brain fog."

Bold colored words: brain state (purple) and others in white.

Small info text below:
"Many people donâ€™t even realize theyâ€™re having a migraine."

Dots as progress indicator (2 dots, 1 filled)

A circular Next button on the bottom right:

Icon: arrow (Icons.arrow_forward), purple background.

Top-right: Skip button (TextButton, white)

ðŸ“‚ FOLDER STRUCTURE (Flutter):
bash
Copy
Edit
/lib
  â”œâ”€â”€ main.dart
  â”œâ”€â”€ splash_screen.dart
  â”œâ”€â”€ onboarding_screen.dart
/assets
  â””â”€â”€ brain.png  # use cropped image from the screenshot or any placeholder
/pubspec.yaml
ðŸ“Œ FUNCTIONALITY:
App starts at SplashScreen and navigates to OnboardingScreen after 2 seconds.

Tapping Next will eventually go to the next onboarding screen (optional now).

Tapping Skip should be wired to navigate to a dummy Home page (you can use print('Skip') for now).

Ensure all fonts, spacing, and alignment match the screenshot.

ðŸ“Ž NOTE:
If possible, extract the brain image from the screenshot itself and use it.

Use GoogleFonts package for smooth font matching (optional).

Make the design pixel-perfect as shown.

âœ… OUTPUT:
A working Flutter app that shows:

Splash screen with Zivora branding

Onboarding screen with brain illustration and styled description

Exact navigation and UI feel as per screenshot
