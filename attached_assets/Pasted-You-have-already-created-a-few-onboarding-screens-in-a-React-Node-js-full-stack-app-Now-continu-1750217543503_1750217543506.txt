You have already created a few onboarding screens in a React + Node.js full-stack app.

Now, continue building the next few fully functional screens (not just UI) for the same app. These screens must connect with the backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB) via proper APIs and manage user state, form submissions, and dynamic content rendering.

✅ Add the Following Screens to the Existing App:
🧠 1. “Get Started with Zivora” Screen
Purpose: First screen after the splash, asking user to log in or sign up.

Design Elements:

A large brain graphic with emojis on top (exact image from reference).

Heading: “Get Started with Zivora”

Subtext: “Create your account or sign in to continue”

Buttons:

Login (purple background)

Sign Up (white background)

“or login with” (divider text)

Apple login, Google login buttons with icons

Footer text: Terms of Service and Privacy Policy

Functionality:

Login and Sign Up should integrate with MongoDB + JWT-based authentication.

Email/password fields must be validated.

OAuth buttons can be mocked or integrated using Google/Firebase login optionally.

🧍‍♀️ 2. “Create Your Profile” Screen
Purpose: Capture user details to personalize experience.

Fields:

Full Name (text input)

Age (number input)

Gender (radio buttons: Female, Male, Other)

Migraine Frequency (radio options: Daily, Weekly, Monthly, etc.)

Health Integration toggles:

Apple Health

Google Fit

Sleep Tracking (on/off switch)

Buttons:

Complete Profile (purple gradient)

Skip for now (optional)

Functionality:

Send all data via POST /api/profile API and store in MongoDB profiles collection.

On Skip, insert partial data and move forward.

🏠 3. Home / Dashboard Screen
Header:

Welcome message with user's name (fetched from backend)

Date display

Icons: Notifications + Profile

Main Section:

Circular Migraine Risk Score with score (e.g., 32) and label (Low Risk)

Supporting text: “Your brain is in a stable state today.”

Button: "View Risk Factors"

Quick Actions:

Log Symptoms (quick entry)

Add Food (track meals)

Recent Activity:

List showing last 3-4 entries: Sleep sync, headache, food logs

Each with icon, time, and title

My Space Section:

Navigable links: Daily Log, Insights, History & Trends, Medications, Settings

Bottom Navigation Bar (fixed):

Tabs: Home, Log, Insights, History, Learn

Backend Integration:

/api/dashboard → fetches all dynamic data from MongoDB.

/api/logs → new entries for food/symptoms should be posted and listed here.

Support JWT-authenticated access only.

🧭 Notes for Integration
Add these screens without affecting previous onboarding screens.

Maintain a consistent theme, typography, color scheme across new and old screens.

Ensure mobile-first responsive design.

All user data should persist in MongoDB.

Use React Router for navigation and route protection for logged-in areas.

🔧 Backend Setup Recap
Use the following endpoints:

POST /api/signup – user registration

POST /api/login – JWT-based login

POST /api/profile – save profile data

GET /api/dashboard – retrieve user-specific dashboard data

POST /api/logs – submit logs like food or headache entries
