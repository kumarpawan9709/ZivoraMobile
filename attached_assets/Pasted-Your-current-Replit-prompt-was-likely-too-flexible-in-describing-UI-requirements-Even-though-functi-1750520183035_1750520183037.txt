Your current Replit prompt was likely too flexible in describing UI requirements. Even though functionality was explained well, it allowed room for layout restructuring, which they took.

✅ STRICT VERSION OF DASHBOARD PROMPT
Here is a revised and locked-down prompt to give Replit so that:

They cannot alter the layout, size, spacing, padding, alignment.

UI structure must exactly match Figma.

Only the data layer is allowed to change.

🚫 DO NOT CHANGE THE VISUAL DESIGN FROM FIGMA.

This is a strict pixel-perfect task to make the **Dashboard** screen functional while keeping the design **exactly as it is in Figma**.

🎯 PURPOSE:
Make this screen functional using dynamic data from backend API and DB, but DO NOT edit layout, padding, icons, positions, fonts, or spacing.

📍 SCREEN: `/dashboard`

📐 Figma: https://www.figma.com/design/Ibyuu3J95W9CMeXqzq46RQ/Zivora-App?node-id=108-4108

✅ STRICT RULES:

1. DO NOT modify layout or move any components.
2. DO NOT stretch or resize elements.
3. DO NOT change font sizes, alignments, padding, colors, spacing.
4. DO NOT switch icon style or button shape.
5. DO NOT change card sizes, radii, or vertical stacking.
6. DO NOT apply custom logic to combine or simplify components.
7. DO NOT make design decisions — follow **Figma exactly**.
8. DO NOT affect other screens.

✅ YOUR JOB: DATA INTEGRATION ONLY

Make each component dynamic with data coming from API or DB. Below are the mappings.

---

🔶 SECTION 1: USER GREETING HEADER
- Show user's first name and current date.
- Profile photo should be displayed circular (if available).
- Data from API: `GET /api/user/profile/:userId`
```json
{ "name": "Sarah", "profile_image": "https://..." }
🔶 SECTION 2: MIGRAINE RISK SCORE CARD

Do NOT change design of circular progress ring.

Do NOT realign it left — it must stay centered and styled like Figma.

Dynamic values:

Score (0–100)

Label (Low, Medium, High)

Status message

Action button → Navigates to /risk-factors

API: GET /api/user/risk-score/:userId

json
Copy
Edit
{ "score": 32, "label": "Low Risk", "message": "Your brain is in a stable state today." }
🔶 SECTION 3: QUICK ACTIONS (2 Buttons)

Keep exactly same icons, spacing, alignment as per Figma.

No stretching or inline styles allowed.

Buttons must route:

Log Symptoms → /log/symptoms

Add Food → /log/food

🔶 SECTION 4: RECENT ACTIVITY TIMELINE

This is a vertical list of 3 cards.

Each should contain icon, activity label, time (right-aligned).

Use rounded card, soft shadow as per Figma.

json
Copy
Edit
[
  { "type": "Food", "description": "Logged lunch", "time": "12:30", "icon": "🍗" },
  { "type": "Sleep", "description": "Sleep data synced", "time": "6:45", "icon": "🛌" },
  { "type": "Symptoms", "description": "Mild headache", "time": "14:15", "icon": "😣" }
]
🔶 SECTION 5: MY SPACE CARDS

5 tappable cards:
