🚀 TASK: Make the “Insights & Predictions” screen fully functional with dynamic data and APIs using React (Frontend) and Node.js (Backend). 

⚠️ STRICT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Do NOT affect or modify any other screen or shared components.
- This task is limited to the `/insights` screen only.
- The layout, spacing, fonts, colors, and UI must exactly match the Figma design — no deviations allowed.
- Do not break navigation or global structure.
- All data must be dynamically fetched from the backend using APIs.
- Do not hardcode any value unless it’s a placeholder for fallback.

🎯 OBJECTIVE:
Match the screen shown in Figma *exactly* and dynamically render each section using real API data pulled for the current user (`userId`).

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

📍 SECTION-WISE FUNCTIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:

✅ 1. Analysis Confidence Box:
- API: `GET /api/user/insight/analysis-confidence/:userId`
- Response:
  {
    "confidencePercent": 87,
    "daysTracked": 30
  }
- Display: `87%` with text “Based on 30 days of data”
- Font size and layout should match Figma

✅ 2. Personalized Trigger Risks:
- API: `GET /api/user/insight/triggers/:userId`
- Sample response:
[
  { "trigger": "Dark Chocolate", "percentage": 78, "note": "Likely migraine trigger" },
  { "trigger": "Red Wine", "percentage": 72, "note": "High correlation with episodes" },
  { "trigger": "Screen Time > 6hrs", "percentage": 65, "note": "Activity-based trigger" },
  { "trigger": "Processed Cheese", "percentage": 58, "note": "Moderate trigger risk" }
]
- Each card should have:
  - Progress bar
  - Percentage
  - Color mapped as per risk: Red > Orange > Yellow > Blue
  - Risk note
- Match card radius, shadow, text size from Figma

✅ 3. Stress & Sleep Patterns:
- API: `GET /api/user/insight/stress-sleep/:userId`
- Sample response:
{
  "stressLevel": "High",
  "avgSleepHours": 6.2,
  "insightNote": "Your migraine risk increases by 43% when you get less than 7 hours of sleep combined with high stress days."
}
- Left Card: Stress → icon and label
- Right Card: Sleep Hours → numeric display
- Bottom: Key Insight note

✅ 4. Risk Predictions:
- API: `GET /api/user/insight/risk-prediction/:userId`
- Sample:
[
  {
    "title": "Tomorrow",
    "risk": "Medium",
    "percentage": 45,
    "note": "45% risk based on weather changes and sleep pattern"
  },
  {
    "title": "This Weekend",
    "risk": "High",
    "percentage": 78,
    "note": "78% risk - Social events often include trigger foods"
  }
]
- Use badge style for "Medium Risk" and "High Risk"
- Match layout spacing and horizontal bar style per Figma

✅ 5. Personalized Recommendations:
- API: `GET /api/user/insight/recommendations/:userId`
- Sample:
[
  {
    "title": "Avoid Dark Chocolate",
    "note": "High trigger probability, consider alternatives"
  },
  {
    "title": "Improve Sleep Schedule",
    "note": "Aim for 7–8 hours, maintain consistent bedtime"
  },
  {
    "title": "Limit Screen Time",
    "note": "Take breaks every 2 hours, use blue light filters"
  }
]
- Icons and text must match spacing from Figma
- Use circle icon container just like in design

✅ 6. "View Analysis" Button:
- Must appear at the bottom
- Button style: Purple gradient, white bold text, full width, rounded corners
- OnClick → Navigate to: `/analysis-report`
- Use React Router for navigation
- This button must be isolated to this screen — do NOT reuse if affects others

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

📦 Backend (Node.js):
- Each API must return mock/sample data for now if no real user data exists
- Use the `userId` passed in params or context
- Store data in MongoDB/PostgreSQL if applicable for production
- Maintain modular controller structure

⚛️ Frontend (React):
- Use local state or `useInsightsData()` custom hook
- Do not use global state
- Error handling: show fallback message or loading placeholders
- Avoid hardcoded values, use API only

📱 Responsive:
- Must be fully responsive (mobile + desktop)
- Spacing, stacking, and wrapping as per Figma

✅ Before Finishing:
- Double-check that no other screen or feature was affected
- All fields and sections render dynamically and visually match the Figma design
- Test navigation from button
- No console errors

Confirm completion and share screenshot of updated screen once done.
