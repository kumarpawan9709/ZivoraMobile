ssue 1: ✅ "Save Entry" button not working properly
❌ Problem:
No success message shown

No redirect or confirmation

Data may not be posting to API or no feedback shown to user

✅ Required Fix:
Make sure the "Save Entry" button triggers a POST request to this endpoint:

bash
Copy
Edit
POST /api/logs/daily
Payload must include all fields: headache, sleep, stress, food entry/barcode, hydration, activity, notes, image (if any), and userId

On successful save, perform these two actions:

✅ Show toast message or alert: "Entry saved successfully!"

✅ Then, redirect user to Dashboard (route: /dashboard) OR show a success confirmation screen depending on Figma

On error, show "Failed to save entry. Please try again." without redirect

🔒 Strict Rule: Do not reload the page. Use proper navigation (React Router or framework router).

🔴 Issue 2: ✅ Back button on top-left not working
❌ Problem:
Clicking the back button changes the URL, but screen doesn't update

✅ Required Fix:
Ensure the back button uses the app’s router method (e.g., navigate(-1) or navigate("/dashboard"))

Use your React/Next/Router navigation system, not just window.location.href

Confirm that:

When user clicks back → it loads previous screen (usually Dashboard or previous tab)

Screen updates immediately with no need for full page refresh

🔒 Strict Rule: This back button must work exactly like native app navigation.

🔁 Additional Instruction After "Save Entry"
✅ After user taps Save Entry:

Option 1: Redirect to /dashboard (Recommended – matches app flow)

Option 2 (Optional): Show a success screen with a message and a CTA like “Go to Dashboard”

Just ensure one of these flows is clearly implemented.

🔍 Checklist for Replit (Final Verification)
 Save Entry makes valid POST to /api/logs/daily with all required fields

 Success message or toast shown

 On success → redirected to Dashboard

 Back button works with proper navigation logic

 No other screens or layouts are changed

 No hard reload used anywhere
