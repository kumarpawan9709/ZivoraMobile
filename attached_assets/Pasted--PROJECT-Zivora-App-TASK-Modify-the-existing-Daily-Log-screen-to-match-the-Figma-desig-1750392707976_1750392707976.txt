🟣 PROJECT: Zivora App  
🔧 TASK: Modify the existing "Daily Log" screen to **match the Figma design layout and style** for mobile devices exactly.  

🎯 GOAL: The current Daily Log screen is working but **does not visually match** the design shown in Figma. You must adjust the layout, spacing, typography, and interactions to **look exactly like the mobile screenshot** provided.

### 🧭 ENTRY POINT:
- This screen opens when user clicks **"View Risk Factors"** on the Dashboard.

### ✅ ACTION ITEMS

🔹 1. **Overall Layout**
- Apply **vertical scroll** layout
- Add **top bar with back icon**, title `Daily Log`, and current date (e.g., January 15, 2025)  
- Use consistent **spacing and padding** as shown in the Figma design

🔹 2. **Food Intake Section**
- Replace the large dotted box with a **rounded container** showing a camera icon and text “Take photo of your meal” (centered)
- Place **barcode scan input** below with label and icon matching the Figma style
- Place **manual entry text area** with correct border-radius and placeholder

🔹 3. **Headache Logging Section**
- Severity selection should be 4 **toggle buttons**: None, Mild, Moderate, Severe  
- Match **color theme and selected button state** exactly (e.g., purple for selected Severe)
- Duration should have **2 side-by-side inputs** with proper label and placeholder

🔹 4. **Custom Triggers Section**
- Divide into 3 parts:
  - **Stress Events / Emotions** with + Add option
  - **Specific Activities** (e.g., Travel, Exercise, etc.) with + Add
  - **Medications** with + Add medication input
- Each tag (e.g., “Stressed”, “Exercise”) should be shown as **rounded pill buttons** with padding, dark background, and light text

🔹 5. **Save Entry Button**
- Should be a **sticky button at bottom**, full-width, with vibrant purple background and white text

### 💡 UI STYLE GUIDE (from Figma)

- Use dark mode theme
- Rounded corners for inputs and cards
- Spacing between sections must be consistent
- Use icons as seen in the Figma (camera, barcode, plus, back arrow)
- Font size, padding, and color should mirror the mobile screenshot

---

### 🔗 BACKEND FUNCTIONALITY (Already Exists)
- On clicking `Save Entry`, call the existing API `POST /api/daily-log` with the proper JSON data.

### 📌 Notes
- You can reuse components like `Input`, `Button`, and `Tag` if already created
- Match colors and layout 1:1 with the mobile Figma layout
- Prioritize responsive behavior and visual fidelity
