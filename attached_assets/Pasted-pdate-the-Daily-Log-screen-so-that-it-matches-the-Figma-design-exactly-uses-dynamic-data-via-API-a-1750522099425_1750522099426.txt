pdate the Daily Log screen so that it matches the Figma design exactly, uses dynamic data via API, and follows strict guidelines to ensure no impact to other screens.

🎯 Core Goals (Reconfirm before starting):
✅ Match Figma screen 100% visually (layout, font sizes, spacing, colors, icons, section order)

✅ All form components must store & load data via API and DB integration

✅ Do not alter or break any other screen

✅ Ensure mobile responsiveness works like Figma mobile view

✅ Multistep structure should flow exactly as designed in Figma

✅ Dummy data can be used in DB for now, but structure should be production-ready

✅ Photo Capture and Barcode Scanner must be implemented and tested functionally (not just visually)

📲 Figma Design Reference:
Refer to Daily Log screen components under /Log tab in Figma.

🧩 Components to Implement (Based on Figma):
1. Food Intake Section
🟪 Photo Capture:

Function: Launch device camera or gallery

Action: Store captured image as mealImage in DB (base64 or file reference)

🟣 Barcode Scanner:

Function: Open camera → scan barcode → auto-fill food details via API

Action: Store barcode in DB, fetch product info via /api/food/barcode/:code

❗ Currently non-functional. Fix required – it is just a label

🔤 Manual Entry:

Textarea to describe food manually (fallback if photo/barcode not used)

2. Headache Logging Section
Toggle group with 4 severity levels: None, Mild, Moderate, Severe

Store as headacheSeverity in DB

3. Sleep Quality Section
Toggle group (e.g., Poor, Average, Good, Excellent)

Store as sleepQuality

4. Stress Level Section
Toggle group (Low/Moderate/High)

Store as stressLevel

5. Activity & Hydration Logging
Water intake (liters or cups) → slider or input

Activity dropdown (Walk, Gym, Yoga, etc.)

Store values dynamically in DB

6. Notes (Optional)
Free text entry

Stored as notes

7. Submit Button
POST all data to backend /api/logs/daily

Should return success/failure response

On success: redirect to dashboard or confirmation

📦 Backend / API Notes:
You may use mock/dummy DB entries initially, but keep all endpoints production-ready

Suggested schema:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "userId": "string",
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "mealImage": "string (base64 or URL)",
  "barcode": "string",
  "manualFoodEntry": "string",
  "headacheSeverity": "string",
  "sleepQuality": "string",
  "stressLevel": "string",
  "hydration": "number",
  "activity": "string",
  "notes": "string"
}
🔒 Strict Do-Nots:
❌ Do not modify UI/UX of other screens

❌ Do not change global layout or tab navigation

❌ Do not hardcode any values

❌ Do not push broken or incomplete features without flagging

✅ Deliverable Expectations:
Daily Log screen fully aligned with Figma

All input values saved via API

Barcode + photo input working

Responsive layout for mobile and desktop

Backend connection working (mock data acceptable if structure is ready)
