You are a full-stack React + Node.js app developer inside Replit. Build the **Settings screen** for the Zivora app using the latest React (frontend), Node.js (backend), and Firebase (as database).

üì± This screen opens when the user clicks the settings icon on the dashboard screen.

üõ†Ô∏è Stack:
- React (with functional components + hooks)
