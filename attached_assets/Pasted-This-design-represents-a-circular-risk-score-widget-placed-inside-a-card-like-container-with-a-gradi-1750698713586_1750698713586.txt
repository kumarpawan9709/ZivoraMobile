This design represents a circular risk score widget placed inside a card-like container with a gradient background. Letâ€™s break down its visual structure step-by-step so you understand how the box and background are layered and styled:

ðŸ§± Outer Structure (Background & Box)
1. Outer Gradient Background
The entire background behind the box has a smooth linear gradientâ€”likely from deep blue to purple.

This gradient is applied to the section or screen container, not the card itself.

This creates contrast and makes the card pop visually.

2. Main Card (Box)
The score card is a rounded rectangle (box) centered on the screen or inside a column.

It has:

Dark background color (#121212 to #1E1E2Eâ€”dark navy/grayish tone)

Rounded corners (border-radius: 16px or 1rem)

Padding inside to create spacing around the content

Subtle shadow for elevated look

ðŸŽ¯ Inside the Box
1. Title
Today's Migraine Risk Score is at the top

Font is bold and slightly smaller than the number below

Likely center-aligned

2. Circular Progress Score
The number 32 is displayed inside a circular progress indicator

Text below shows Low Risk

The circle border is a visual progress arc, using stroke/fill gradient to show how much of 100 the value 32 represents

This is typically implemented using SVG or a library like react-circular-progressbar

3. Status Badge: "Safe Zone"
Below the score, a pill-shaped badge (Safe Zone)

Light purple or gradient background

Rounded (border-radius: 999px)

White text, centered

This is a status indicator

4. Insight Message
Below the badge, a short insight:
"Your brain is in a stable state today. Light triggers are manageable."

Font is smaller and lighter in color (grayish)

Center-aligned

âœ¨ Summary of Visual Layers
Layer	Description
Screen BG	Gradient (purple â†’ blue) background of the entire section
Card Box	Dark, rounded box with padding and subtle shadow
Progress Ring	Circular progress bar showing the score visually
Badge	Pill-shaped status indicator below the score
Insight Text	Light, center-aligned text giving a one-liner interpretation of the score

âœ… To Recreate This:
Use div with gradient background for container

Inside, place a card component with dark bg and rounded corners

Use react-circular-progressbar or a similar lib for the ring

Add a status badge using a span with border-radius: 999px

Place insight text at bottom
