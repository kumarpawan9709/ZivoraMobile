Please review all screens and their respective API integrations across the application.

⚠️ Do not make any changes at this stage — this is purely for alignment.
We want to confirm that we’re on the right track to building a fully functional app before proceeding with the final phase of enhancements.

Kindly go through the following questions and answer them in detail:

🔍 General Review – App Architecture & Data Flow
✅ Are all major screens from the Figma design implemented in the app?

If any screen is still pending (UI or logic), please list them clearly.

✅ Is each implemented screen powered by dynamic API data from the database (not static)?

If any screen still uses hardcoded or placeholder data, please specify which ones.

✅ Are all API responses specific to the logged-in user (using userId or token)?

If any API fetches generic or incorrect data, highlight that.

✅ Is every form or log submission correctly routed through the backend and saving in the DB?

Example: Daily Logs, Symptom Logs, Profile, Triggers, Medications, etc.

🔍 Screen-Specific Functional Checks
🟢 Daily Log
Is all data (meal photo, barcode, symptom severity) saved and loaded based on date?

Can users navigate to past dates and view their entries?

Is the “Save Entry” button correctly validating input and saving to DB?

🟣 Log Symptoms
Are symptoms saved through API and reflected in DB?

Are saved symptoms visible anywhere (e.g., History screen)?

Is trigger + intensity + time data handled correctly?

Are icons implemented for each trigger type?

🔵 Dashboard
Is the Risk Score section pulling accurate live data?

Are the Quick Actions functional and correctly routed?

Is the Notification bell showing unread badge and routing properly?

🟠 History & Trends
Is this screen showing actual user logs (Daily Log, Symptoms, Risk history)?

Are 7, 30, 90 day filters fetching accurate, filtered DB data?

🟤 Export Health Data
Is the exported PDF dynamically generated with real DB data?

Is the format consistent, readable, and scoped to user selections?

Does CSV export work correctly as well?

🔴 Insights & Predictions
Are all insights (Confidence Score, Triggers, Sleep/Stress Pattern, Risk Predictions) dynamically fetched from APIs?

Are drill-down buttons functional (e.g., “View Analysis”)?

🟡 Medication Screen
Is medication data being pulled from DB?

Is the Add Reminder button functional?

Is dosage tracking working or planned?

⚙️ Settings
Are toggles (Apple Health, Fitbit) currently functional or just visual?

Are links to Privacy Policy / Terms of Service live?

Is the user profile editable and stored in DB?

🧪 Technical Checks
Are all forms/components properly validated (with field-level errors)?

Are successful submissions showing feedback (toast, redirect)?

Are API errors handled gracefully (fallback messages, console logs)?

Is routing consistent (Back button works, screen renders properly)?

🚨 Final Assurance
Do you feel the current app structure, DB schema, and API integration is clean, modular, and production-ready?

Are there any hidden blockers or potential architecture issues you would recommend we address now?

What is left to be done before you consider this app fully functional and ready for production testing?

📝 Please answer all questions based on your current implementation so we can confirm alignment and finalize any missing features or changes in the correct order.
