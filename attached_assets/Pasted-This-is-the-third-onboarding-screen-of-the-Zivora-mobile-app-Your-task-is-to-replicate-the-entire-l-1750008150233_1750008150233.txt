This is the third onboarding screen of the Zivora mobile app. Your task is to replicate the entire layout and UI flow.

ðŸŽ¯ OBJECTIVE:
Build a dark-themed onboarding screen with the following:

âœ… Top Section:
Text (centered):

"Know when your brain is" â€“ white

"vulnerable." â€“ purple/violet (Colors.purpleAccent)

Use RichText with different TextSpan for styling.

Skip Button:

Positioned in the top-right corner

Text button: "Skip" (white color)

On press: Just print("Skip pressed")

âœ… Middle Section:
Gauge/Risk Meter:

A semi-circular color meter:

Green arc (0â€“40): Safe

Yellow arc (41â€“70): Caution

Red arc (71â€“100): Sensitive

A small icon in the center (use a CircleAvatar with a risk icon placeholder like Icons.speed)

Below the meter: Label "Risk Score" (white, bold)

Underneath: Three colored labels with ranges:

Green: "0â€“40\nSafe"

Yellow: "41â€“70\nCaution"

Red: "71â€“100\nSensitive"

Use colored Container widgets or Row to align them side by side

âœ… Info Box:
A rounded black box with the following text:

css
Copy
Edit
Zivora analyzes your body, sleep, habits, and environment to generate a daily Migraine Risk Score â€” helping you manage triggers like food, stress, and noise.
Zivora word in purple.

Text style: Light-colored (Colors.white70) with some spacing

Background: Darker black with rounded corners (BoxDecoration)

âœ… Checkbox Section (Bottom):
A standard checkbox with this long label:

css
Copy
Edit
I understand Zivora isnâ€™t for diagnosis or treatment, but helps interpret migraine patterns after a healthcare providerâ€™s diagnosis.
Align left, multiline text wrapping properly.

Use CheckboxListTile or Row with Checkbox and Expanded(child: Text(...)).

âœ… Bottom Section:
Page indicators (three dots):

2 dots unselected

1 dot filled (third one)

Purple active dot

Next Button:

Circular FloatingActionButton or Container

Background: Purple (Colors.purpleAccent)

Icon: Forward arrow (Icons.arrow_forward)

Positioned bottom right

ðŸ’¡ FUNCTIONALITY:
Tapping the Skip button should print to console for now.

Tapping Next should just move to a dummy next screen or print a message.

Checkbox should be functional (toggle on/off).

ðŸ§© ASSET INFO:
If required, you can extract the gauge graphic from the uploaded screenshot and use it as an image asset:
Name the file: assets/risk_gauge.png

Alternatively, you can replicate the gauge meter using CustomPaint, Stack, or SVG if Replit supports it â€” but fallback to an image if easier.

ðŸ“‚ FILE STRUCTURE SUGGESTION:
bash
Copy
Edit
/lib
  â”œâ”€â”€ onboarding_screen_3.dart
/assets
  â””â”€â”€ risk_gauge.png (optional)
/pubspec.yaml
âœ… OUTPUT EXPECTATION:
A pixel-perfect Flutter screen that mirrors the attached image, fully functional with:

Rich styled text

Risk meter visuals

Informational box

Checkbox interaction

Navigation buttons
