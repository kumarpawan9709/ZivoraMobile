❓Questions for Replit Team
Please confirm the following to ensure we’re aligned with the Figma expectations and haven't deviated:

1️⃣ User Profile
✅ You’ve displayed "Good morning, Sarah" and the correct date — but Figma includes a circular profile image (top-left).
❓Is profile image support implemented from user API? If not, when will it be added?

2️⃣ Migraine Risk Gauge
✅ The risk score circular component and "Low Risk" label are now center-aligned and styled well.
❓Is the risk score (32) fetched dynamically from /api/user/risk-score/:userId or is it still static?

3️⃣ Quick Actions
✅ “Log Symptoms” and “Add Food” are styled well.
Figma indicates equal button sizes and stacked on mobile.
❓Have you tested the responsiveness on mobile to ensure stacked layout appears correctly?

4️⃣ Recent Activity
❌ Currently only one entry visible, and missing icon + category (like "Sleep", "Symptoms", etc.)
Figma shows 3 activities with icons, type, and timestamps.

❓Is the backend returning full list (limit 3)?
❓Are you mapping type icons dynamically like 🍗 for food, 😴 for sleep, 😣 for symptoms?

5️⃣ My Space Cards (Missing)
❌ The "My Space" section from Figma is not visible here. It should include navigation to:

Daily Log

Insights

History & Trends

Medications

Settings

❓Is this section under development or intentionally hidden? If in progress, ETA?

✅ Action Needed From Replit:
Please confirm the following:

No layout modifications were made.

All data is now coming via API and not hardcoded.

Responsive mobile view has been tested and matches Figma.

"My Space" section is coming next and will follow exact Figma layout.
