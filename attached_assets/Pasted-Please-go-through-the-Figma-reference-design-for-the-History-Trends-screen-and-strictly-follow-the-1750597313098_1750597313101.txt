Please go through the Figma reference design for the History & Trends screen and strictly follow the instructions below.

🎯 Objective:
Rebuild the History & Trends screen to exactly match the Figma design both visually and functionally using React (frontend) and Node.js (backend) APIs. Ensure no other screen or component is affected by these changes.

✅ Screen Breakdown & Requirements:
1. Tabs & Filters
Tabs at the top:

History tab (default selected)

Trends tab (switches view)

Two filters:

Time Period (This Month, Last 3 Months, etc.)

Severity (All Severities, Mild, Moderate, Severe)

Implement as reusable filter components

Pull filtered data via API:

GET /api/user/history/:userId?period=30d&severity=all

2. History Section (Left Tab)
🧠 Headache Log Cards (Dynamic List)
Each entry should include:

Severity level with color dot (e.g., red = severe)

Date & duration

Triggers (tags like Stress, Lack of Sleep, etc.)

Location & weather condition (icons shown in Figma)

Rating out of 10

Additional notes text

Data API:

GET /api/user/history/:userId

Accept filters via query params (period, severity)

3. Trends Section (Right Tab)
📊 Episode Summary Stats (Top 3 Boxes)
Total Episodes

Average Severity

Average Duration
API: GET /api/user/trends/summary/:userId?period=30d

📈 Episode Frequency Trend (Line Chart)
Use recharts or any React chart library to display graph

Plot migraines/day across the selected time period
API: GET /api/user/trends/frequency/:userId?period=30d

🕒 Recent Episodes Cards
Styled compact cards with:

Date

Duration

Triggers (tags)

Severity dots
API: GET /api/user/trends/recent/:userId?limit=3

📉 Health Correlations (Graphs)
Heart Rate Variability

Sleep Quality

Stress Levels

Each graph should show correlation and confidence %
API:

GET /api/user/trends/correlation/heart-rate/:userId

GET /api/user/trends/correlation/sleep/:userId

GET /api/user/trends/correlation/stress/:userId

🍽 Food Trigger Patterns
Horizontal bar chart showing top food triggers with %
API: GET /api/user/trends/food-triggers/:userId

4. 📤 Export Health Data Button
Clicking should trigger download of PDF/CSV
API: GET /api/user/trends/export/:userId
(Returns downloadable file)

⚙️ Functional Requirements
Data must be dynamically pulled based on:

Selected time range

Selected severity filter

Handle all API responses with proper loading & fallback states

Use JWT to get user ID and send with all requests

Ensure pagination or scroll works properly if list is long

Mobile responsive: charts and boxes should stack or scroll neatly

🚫 Important Constraints
Do not make changes to other components or screens like:

Dashboard

Daily Log

Insights

Work only inside the HistoryScreen.tsx and related trend components

Use modular, reusable component structure

Once completed, confirm the following:
✅ Figma design matched exactly
✅ All API data integrated correctly
✅ Filters are working
✅ No hardcoded data remains
✅ Responsive layout maintained
✅ Export working

Please confirm once it's complete or if any clarification is needed before implementation.
