**Dear App Store Review Team,**

Thank you for your detailed feedback. We have addressed all the issues identified in your review and are resubmitting our app with the following resolutions:

## Issue 1: Guideline 2.3.3 - Performance - Accurate Metadata

**✅ RESOLVED**: 
- We have **removed Sign in with Apple and Google login** from the current app version
- The app now uses **standard email/password authentication only**
- Screenshots now accurately reflect the current app functionality
- All promotional materials have been updated to match the actual user interface

## Issue 2: Guideline 2.1 - Performance - App Completeness  
**Previous Issue**: Error message when logging in with demo account (appstore@zivora.app/appstore123)

**✅ RESOLVED**:
- **Demo account credentials updated**: `demo@zivora.com` / `demo123`
- **Authentication system completely rebuilt** with improved error handling
- **Production API endpoint verified working**: All login functionality tested extensively

- **Clean user interface**: Removed all debug information and technical messages

## Additional Improvements Made:

## Next Steps:
We have thoroughly tested the app on supported iOS devices and confirmed all authentication flows work correctly. The demo account is fully functional, and all core features are accessible.

**Ready for Re-review**: The app is now complete, stable, and accurately represented in all metadata and screenshots.
