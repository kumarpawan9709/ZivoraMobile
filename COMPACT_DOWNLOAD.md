# Compact Zivora Source Code Download

## Smaller Download Created

I've created a much smaller version by excluding:
- `node_modules/` (install with npm install)
- `attached_assets/` (large image files)
- Build files and logs
- Previous archive files

## Download Options

### Option 1: Compact Archive
**File:** `zivora-source-compact.tar.gz` 
**Size:** Much smaller than previous version
**Contents:** All source code, configurations, and essential files

### Option 2: Individual File Downloads
If the archive is still too large, you can download key files individually:

**Essential Files:**
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `capacitor.config.json` - Mobile app configuration
- `client/` folder - React frontend
- `server/` folder - Node.js backend
- `shared/` folder - Shared schemas
- `ios/` folder - iOS project structure

### Option 3: GitHub Repository
Create a GitHub repository to clone the project:
1. Create new repo at github.com/yourusername/zivora-app
2. Upload the compact source code
3. Clone with: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zivora-app.git`

## After Download Setup

1. **Extract files**
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start development:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. **Generate iOS:**
   ```bash
   npx cap add ios
   npx cap sync ios
   ```

## What's Included

- Complete React app with all screens
- Node.js backend with database
- Updated authentication (email/password only)
- Custom app icon configuration
- iOS Capacitor setup
- App Store compliance updates

The compact version contains all your recent changes without the large asset files.
