# Download Instructions - Zivora Updated Source Code

## Compact Download Available

I've created a much smaller version by excluding large files:

**File:** `zivora-source-compact.tar.gz` 
**Size:** Much smaller (excludes node_modules, build files, assets)

## Download Methods

### Method 1: Direct Download from Replit
1. In the Replit file browser, look for `zivora-source-compact.tar.gz`
2. Right-click the file → "Download"
3. Extract on your local machine

### Method 2: Individual File Download
If the archive still doesn't work, download these key files separately:

**Essential Files:**
- `package.json` (dependencies)
- `capacitor.config.json` (mobile config)
- `client/` folder (React frontend)
- `server/` folder (Node.js backend)
- `shared/` folder (schemas)
- `ios/` folder (iOS project)

### Method 3: GitHub Repository
I can help you create a GitHub repository:

1. Create new repository on GitHub.com
2. Name: `zivora-migraine-tracker`
3. Upload the project files
4. Clone locally: `git clone https://github.com/[username]/zivora-migraine-tracker`

## After Download

Once you have the source code:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Generate iOS project
npx cap add ios
npx cap sync ios
```
